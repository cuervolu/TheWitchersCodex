      "description": "Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.\n\nDuring the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.\n\nDespite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose 'Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde', but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so 'Geralt' was all that remained of his chosen name. 'Of Rivia' was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga, conferring on him the formal title 'of Rivia', which amused him. He, therefore, became a true knight.",

He also became the King of Cintra after marrying a false Cirilla in 1268.\n\nHis rule of Nilfgaard was highly aggressive, often pursuing expansionist policies similar to those of his predecessors.

He chose his people well and crushed many plots against him. He was ruthless toward traitors and moved towards his goals with great determination.\n\nHe was publicly favorable to the Elder Races, in stark contrast to monarchs of the North."

      "description": "Gaunter O'Dimm, sometimes called Master Mirror or Man of Glass, was a powerful individual, creating pacts with people in exchange for their souls and being able to control time with a mere clap of his hands. Not much is known about Gaunter before his meeting with Geralt, but he stated that he was a former mirror merchant-turned-mangy vagrant because of the war.\n\nGaunter, while a primarily antagonistic entity, is a creature of extremes and ambiguity. While Shakeslock called him 'evil incarnate,' Gaunter doesn't fit so neatly into general nor absolute definitions. For the most part he is passive and almost never takes overt actions towards his aims. He often obscures his goals and desires and even the one definitive aim he has (the collection of souls) is wrapped in a veil of inscrutability as Gaunter never makes it clear which souls he is actively interested in or why.\n\nGaunter seems to take pleasure in the suffering of others, however he is only ever shown tormenting or harming people that have given him 'just cause.' He torments and savors the fear of those he makes deals with but only ever seems to make deals with malicious individuals who either are or capable of hurting people for their own ends such as Olgierd whom he rightly described as 'a degenerate monster.' In spite of this, Gaunter makes no distinctions between the severity of one's 'misdeeds' as he horribly cursed a noblewoman and ruined her life while twisting her into a monster for insulting him and refusing hospitality when he came to her door seeking a handout. He also ruthlessly tormented Olgierd's brother's ghost after the spirit refused to leave Geralt's body when Gaunter politely directed the ghost to return to its rest. Gaunter seems to use any excuse to enact torments on others and uses their 'offense' as justification to punish them while taking pleasure in their misery.\n\nFor all of Gaunter's devious and maliciousness, he can also be surprisingly good natured, fair, and even benign towards others. He engages in light hearted banter with common folk such as talking to women about baking while also enjoying the simple pleasures of the company of others and having a good drink. He speaks in a disgusted tone when talking about the sins of others like Olgierd while giving genuine advice to people he takes a liking to such as giving Geralt advice about making Shani happy and later (based in the player's choices) tells Geralt what he needs to know to save Ciri with a tone of sympathy in his voice. In fact, if Geralt performs all of his tasks for Gaunter an lets him take Olfgierd's soul, he rewards Geralt for his service with no strings attached nor clever wordplay to bring Geralt misfortune.

It was through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits. She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never used them on herself because ironically, she was allergic to potions, and used amulets to treat herself. She was also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.",
